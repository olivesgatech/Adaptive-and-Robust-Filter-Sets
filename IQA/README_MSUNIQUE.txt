This is a demonstration of the algorithm described in the above mentioned paper. Given an original and a distorted image, UNIQUE gives out a score 
that approximates the perceptual quality of the distorted image. The score lies between 0 and 1 (1 being the best quality).

You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please refer to its original source (cite our paper and our web page at
https://ghassanalregib.com/unique-unsupervised-image-quality-estimation/).

Usage :

Run the demo.m file.
